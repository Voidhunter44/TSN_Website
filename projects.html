    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <p>Here's a list of some projects I'm proud of:</p>
</div>
  <!-- Project Sections -->
    <!-- Project 1 -->
    <div class="project-section">
      <img src="media/Keychain.png" alt="Custom Keychain" class="project-img" width="200" height="100" />
      <div class="project-text">
        <h2>Keychain</h2>
        <p>I designed a custom keychain in Blender with my name on it, creating a base, adding text, and combining them with the Boolean modifier. I added a keyring hole, extruded for thickness, and aligned everything precisely. This project improved my shape-combining skills and gave me ideas for modeling a full keychain set next.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Project 2 -->
    <div class="project-section">
      <img src="media/Low-poly Cat.png" alt="Low-poly Cat" class="project-img" />
      <div class="project-text">
        <h2>Low-poly Cat</h2>
        <p>I created a low poly cat in Blender using a cube and tools like Extrude, Loop Cut, and the Mirror Modifier. The challenge was keeping the legs and tail simple yet natural while balancing clean edges and few polygons. This project improved my understanding of low poly modeling and gave me ideas for adding textures or animation next.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Project 3 -->
    <div class="project-section">
      <img src="media/Plant Pot.png" alt="Plant Pot" class="project-img" />
      <div class="project-text">
        <h2>Plant Pot</h2>
        <p>I made a simple plant pot in Blender using a cylinder, shaping the rim and hollow with Inset and Extrude, then adding panel details for texture. The challenge was keeping the walls balanced while working on the inside. This project improved my skills with hollow shapes and small details, and I plan to model a plant to go inside next.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

        <!-- Project 4 -->
    <div class="project-section">
      <img src="media/Tank.png" alt="Tank" class="project-img" />
      <div class="project-text">
        <h2>Tank</h2>
        <p>I made a simple tank in Blender using cubes and cylinders, shaping the body, turret, and cannon with tools like Scale, Extrude, and the Mirror Modifier. The tracks were built by duplicating one link, and wheels were added with cylinders. This project taught me how to build mechanical objects from simple shapes, and I’m considering modeling a full environment next.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

        <!-- Project 5 -->
    <div class="project-section">
      <img src="media/Game Character.png" alt="Game Character" class="project-img" />
      <div class="project-text">
        <h2>Game Character</h2>
        <p>I made a low poly character in Blender with a funny French mustache, shaping it from cubes using Extrude, Loop Cut, and the Mirror Modifier. I rigged it with Armature and weight painting, learning how to make the model move naturally. This project taught me how to take a design from simple shapes to animation, and I plan to create a scene for it next.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

            <!-- Project 6 -->
    <div class="project-section">
      <img src="media/Easy Maze.png" alt="Easy Maze" class="project-img" />
      <div class="project-text">
        <h2>Easy Maze</h2>
        <p>I created a simple maze in Blender by cutting walls from a plane and extruding them upward, then adding a stone texture from Fabs Library. The main challenge was keeping paths wide enough for a character. This project taught me about level design, textures, and inspired me to make a small game with the maze.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

            <!-- Project 7 -->
    <div class="project-section">
      <img src="media/Hard Maze.png" alt="Hard Maze" class="project-img" />
      <div class="project-text">
        <h2>Hard Maze</h2>
        <p>I created a 3D maze in Unreal Engine using cube shapes for the layout, then added stone and metal textures plus lighting for atmosphere. The challenge was making it tricky but fair, so I playtested and adjusted the design. This project taught me how to build environments from shapes to lighting, and I plan to add puzzles, obstacles, and animation next.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

                <!-- Project 8 -->
    <div class="project-section">
      <video src="media/Maze Play.mp4" class="project-video" controls>

      </video>
      <div class="project-text">
        <h2>Maze Play</h2>
        <p>Maze Play is a gameplay recording of me completing two mazes: one easy and one harder. It shows differences in difficulty, speed, and pathfinding. It highlights how players adapt as mazes get more complex and how level design changes the gameplay experience.</p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <h1>Reflections</h1>
<p>These projects helped me grow, from making tanks and characters to modeling props like flower pots. I learned to:</p>
<div class="project-text">
  <ul>
    <li>Break complex shapes into simple parts</li>
    <li>Use modifiers to work faster</li>
    <li>Keep models clean and balanced</li>
    <li>Rig characters for animation</li>
    <li>Apply textures and materials</li>
    <li>Turn basic shapes into functional models</li>
    <li>Plan ahead for builds</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>Next, I want to make full scenes like a battlefield, garage, or small animated world, and keep improving in texturing, rigging, and animation. Every step gets me closer to turning ideas into working 3D creations, and that’s what I love most.</p>
