    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <p>Here's a list of some projects I'm proud of:</p>

  <!-- Project Sections -->
    <!-- Project 1 -->
    <div class="project-section">
      <img src="images/KeyChain.png" alt="Custom Keychain" class="project-img" />
      <div class="project-text">
        <h2>Keychain</h2>
        <p>For a class project, I designed a custom keychain in Blender with my name on it. I started by modeling a flat base using a scaled cube, then added my name using the Text tool. After converting the text to a mesh, I combined it with the base using the Boolean modifier and added a small cylinder to create the keyring hole.
I used Extrude to give it thickness and adjusted everything with Move and Scale to get the layout just right. One of the trickiest parts was making sure the text wasn’t floating or cutting through the tag weirdly — it took some precision.
This project helped me get more comfortable working with multiple objects and combining shapes cleanly. I can see these skills being useful for 3D printing, product design, or making custom gifts. Next, I want to try modeling a key or maybe even a whole keychain set.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Project 2 -->
    <div class="project-section">
      <img src="images/Low-poly Cat.png" alt="Low-poly Cat" class="project-img" />
      <div class="project-text">
        <h2>Low-poly Cat</h2>
        <p>As part of a class project, I created a low poly cat in Blender. I started with a cube and used tools like Extrude, Loop Cut, and Move to shape the body, head, legs, and tail. I used the Mirror Modifier to make both sides match and the Subdivision Surface to smooth it out without losing the low poly look.
One of the biggest challenges was keeping the legs and tail simple while still making them look natural. I had to stay focused on clean edges and keeping the model balanced with as few polygons as possible.
This project helped me understand how to build shapes from simple geometry and how to keep things readable even without lots of detail. It showed me how low poly art works, especially for games or animation.
I'm proud of how it turned out. It taught me patience, planning, and how fun 3D modeling can be. Next, I want to learn how to add textures and maybe animate a simple scene.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Project 3 -->
    <div class="project-section">
      <img src="images/Plant Pot.png" alt="Plant Pot" class="project-img" />
      <div class="project-text">
        <h2>Plant Pot</h2>
        <p>I made a simple plant pot in Blender for a class project. I started with a cylinder mesh and used the Inset and Extrude tools to shape the rim and hollow out the inside. Then I cut the surface into small panels and extruded them slightly to give it a more realistic texture.
The challenge was keeping the shape balanced — not too thick or thin — especially while working on the inside without breaking the structure. I had to stay focused on keeping it clean and simple.
This project helped me get better at working with hollow shapes and adding small details without overcomplicating the model. I see how this could be useful in product design or creating 3D props for games.
Next, I want to model a plant to go inside, maybe something like a cactus or sunflower. It felt good to turn a basic shape into something realistic, and it helped me build confidence with simple forms in Blender.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

        <!-- Project 4 -->
    <div class="project-section">
      <img src="images/Tank.png" alt="Tank" class="project-img" />
      <div class="project-text">
        <h2>Tank</h2>
        <p>I made a simple tank in Blender for a class project. I started with a cube and shaped the body using Scale, Extrude, and Loop Cut tools. The cannon was made with a cylinder, and I used a sliced cylinder for the turret. I applied the Mirror Modifier to keep both sides even and clean.
For the tracks, I modeled one link and duplicated it around the base. I made the wheels using cylinders and placed them evenly underneath the tank.
I learned how to break machines into simple shapes and use modifiers to save time. The hardest part was getting the cannon to rotate properly and aligning the tracks without messing up the shape.
This project helped me understand how to build mechanical objects with basic tools. I’m thinking of modeling a full environment next — maybe a battlefield or a garage. It felt awesome seeing something that looked strong and functional come together from scratch.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

        <!-- Project 5 -->
    <div class="project-section">
      <img src="images/Game Character.png" alt="Game Character" class="project-img" />
      <div class="project-text">
        <h2>Game Character</h2>
        <p>I made a low poly character in Blender for a class project — and it even has a funny little French mustache! I started with a cube and used Extrude, Loop Cut, and Scale to shape the body, arms, legs, and head. I added the Mirror Modifier to keep both sides even and used simple shapes to build the mustache.
After modeling, I created a skeleton using Armature and placed the bones carefully inside the character. I then used weight painting so the bones could move the mesh properly. It was my first time rigging a model, and it made the character feel alive.
The hardest part was weight painting — making sure the arms didn’t bend in weird ways took a lot of trial and error. But I learned how to take a design from simple shapes all the way to animation.
These skills are great for game design or storytelling through animation. Next, I want to build a small scene for the character to walk around in. This project showed me how to bring 3D ideas to life with both structure and motion.</p>

            <!-- Project 6 -->
    <div class="project-section">
      <img src="images/Easy Maze.png" alt="Easy Maze" class="project-img" />
      <div class="project-text">
        <h2>Easy Maze</h2>
        <p>I created a simple maze in Blender for a class project. I started with a plane and used the Knife Tool to cut out the walls. Then, I extruded the walls upward to create a 3D effect.
I added a material to the walls to give them a stone texture, which I found online. The hardest part was making sure the paths were wide enough for a character to walk through.
This project taught me a lot about level design and how to create interesting environments. I also learned how to use UV mapping to apply textures properly.
I'm happy with the final result and plan to create a small game where a character can navigate the maze.</p>

            <!-- Project 7 -->
    <div class="project-section">
      <img src="images/Hard Maze.png" alt="Hard Maze" class="project-img" />
      <div class="project-text">
        <h2>Hard Maze</h2>
        <p>I created a detailed 3D maze in Unreal Engine as part of a class project. The layout was designed using simple cube shapes with the cube grid tools, but the final result looked like a real game level, filled with twists, dead ends, and paths that made exploring fun.
To make it feel more realistic, I added textures like stone, metal, and steel to the walls. I also used lighting to create a moody atmosphere — some areas are bright and open, while others are dark and mysterious. This helped me see how materials and lighting can completely change how a space feels.
One challenge was making the maze both tricky and fair. I playtested it multiple times to tweak confusing areas and balance the difficulty. I also started learning how to add basic interaction to the level, like player movement.
This project taught me how to build an environment from scratch — from shapes and textures to lighting and layout. Next, I want to add a fully interactive player with puzzles, obstacles, and maybe some animation. Working in Unreal Engine showed me how games are built step by step, and how much design and logic go into every scene.</p>
I'm happy with the final result and plan to create a small game where a character can navigate the maze.</p>

    <h1>Reflections</h1>
<p>These projects helped me grow in different ways — from building mechanical objects like tanks to designing characters and modeling simple props like flower pots. Each one taught me something new:</p>
      <div class="project-text">
        <ul>
          <li> How to break down complex shapes into simple parts</li>
          <li> How to use modifiers to speed up modeling</li>
          <li> How to keep things clean and balanced while modeling</li>
          <li> How to rig characters for animation</li>
          <li> How to apply textures and materials effectively</li>
          <li> How to turn basic shapes into strong, functional models</li>
          <li> How to plan ahead when building characters or machines</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>What’s next? I want to build full scenes , maybe a battlefield, a garage, or even a simple animated world. I also want to keep learning how to texture, rig, and animate. Each step makes me better at turning 3D ideas into real, working things. And that’s what I love about it.</p>
