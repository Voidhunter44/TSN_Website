    <h1>About Me</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="project-section">
    <p>Hello, I’m Yousha.</p>
    <p>I’m a 14-year-old student from Boston, originally from Pakistan. I attend John D. O’Bryant School of Mathematics and Science. I enjoy combining logic, design, and storytelling to develop projects that are both creative and practical.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project-section">
    <h2>My Passions</h2>
    <p>I am passionate about creating interactive experiences such as games, tools, and visual projects. I appreciate the creative process of design and the problem-solving challenges of coding. For me, the most rewarding part is turning an idea into a working project.</p>
    <p>Some of my main interests include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Low poly 3D game assets</li>
      <li>Making mobile apps</li>
      <li>Applying physics and real-world logic</li>
      <li>Understanding how technology impacts people’s lives</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="project-section">
    <h2>My Expertise</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Designing stylized, efficient low poly game environments and assets</li>
      <li>Developing mobile applications using various programming languages</li>
      <li>Writing code that automates tasks and solves real problems</li>
      <li>Using tools like Blender and Canva to visualize and prototype ideas</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whether I’m creating a character rig, building a timer app, or developing a physics-based mini-game, I aim for simplicity, usefulness, and creativity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project-section">
    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>As a child, I was curious about how things worked — often taking apart remote controls to explore their mechanics (though I usually ended up breaking them). This curiosity still drives me today, but now I channel it into building real projects using professional tools.</p>
    <p>I am motivated by the question, “What if I try this?” and the satisfaction that comes when an idea becomes a functional app, model, or concept. I do this because I value the moment when something I built works successfully.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project-section">
    <h2>What Sets Me Apart</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I pay attention to details others might overlook — like user experience, load times, and visual polish.</li>
      <li>I strive to balance creativity with functionality in every project.</li>
      <li>Despite my age, I’m eager to learn and master tools many don’t explore until later.</li>
      <li>I am committed to continuous improvement, whether in my skills or personal routines.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="project-section">
    <h2>What I’m Seeking</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Gain experience through internships or volunteer work in tech, design, game development, or app creation</li>
      <li>Shadow professionals in creative or technical roles</li>
      <li>Collaborate on projects with other developers or designers</li>
      <li>Build connections that encourage my growth and challenge my skills</li>
      <li>Develop practical experience beyond tutorials and coursework</li>
    </ul>
