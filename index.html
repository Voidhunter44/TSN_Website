  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, welcome. My name is Yousha Ahmed.</p>
  <p>I’m a 14-year-old creator, builder, and thinker from Boston, originally from Pakistan. I’m a student in the Engineering Pathway at John D. O’Bryant School of Math & Science, and I love combining logic, design, and storytelling to make cool things that actually work.</p>

  <h2>What I’m Passionate About</h2>
  <p>I’m passionate about building things that people can interact with like games, tools, or visual experiences. I love the creative side of design and the problem solving side of code. To me, there's something powerful about starting with nothing and ending up with a working project.</p>
  <p>I’m especially drawn to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Low poly 3D game assets</li>
    <li>Clean mobile apps</li>
    <li>Physics and real-world logic</li>
    <li>Learning how tech connects to people’s lives</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What I Do (My Niche)</h2>
  <p>I design and build projects that sit between games, design, and development. My niche is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Creating low poly game environments and assets that are stylized, lightweight, and fun</li>
    <li>Developing apps using Flutter for smooth mobile experiences</li>
    <li>Writing code in Python and Dart to automate or solve real problems</li>
    <li>Using Blender and Canva to visualize or prototype my ideas</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Whether I’m building a character rig, a timer app, or a mini physics-based game, I focus on making things that are simple, useful, and creative.</p>

  <h2>Why I Do It (Short Story)</h2>
  <p>When I was younger, I used to take apart remote controls and try to "fix" them (spoiler: I usually broke them). But I never stopped wondering how things worked. That same energy drives me today but now I’ve leveled up with real tools and real purpose.</p>
  <p>I still ask, “What if I try this?” but now the answer sometimes turns into a working app, a model, or a concept people can actually use. I do it because I love that moment when something finally works and I know I built it myself.</p>

  <h2>What Makes Me Unique</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I care about the small details that others skip like background shadows, load times, or how a user feels using something.</li>
    <li>I don’t just focus on code or looks — I aim for the balance between creative and functional.</li>
    <li>I'm young, but I’m not afraid to go deep into tools and learn things most people my age haven’t touched yet.</li>
    <li>I keep improving whether it’s adding tiny changes to my workout routine or making my app UI one pixel at a time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What I’m Looking For</h2>
  <p>Right now, I’m open to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Internship or volunteer opportunities in tech, design, game development, or app building</li>
    <li>Shadowing someone in a creative or technical role</li>
    <li>Collaborating on projects with other developers or designers</li>
    <li>Networking with people who can help me grow or challenge me</li>
    <li>Deepening my skills through real-world experience, not just tutorials</li>
  </ul>
